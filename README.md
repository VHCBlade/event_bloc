# event_bloc

Event Bloc is an event-based implementation of the BLoC pattern, the recommended State Management Pattern for Flutter by Google!

Event Bloc uses events and the [provider package](https://pub.dev/packages/provider) to simplify the state management process. It also gets rid of a lot of the boilerplate that is associated with other implementation of the BLoC pattern.
