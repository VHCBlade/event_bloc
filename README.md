# Event BLoC

Event Bloc is an event-based implementation of the BLoC pattern, the recommended State Management Pattern for Flutter by Google!

Event Bloc uses events and the [provider package](https://pub.dev/packages/provider) to simplify the state management process. It also gets rid of a lot of the boilerplate that is associated with other implementation of the BLoC pattern.

## Features

Add this to your Flutter app to:
* Add an easy to use State Management Solution that is equally easy to maintain
* Get the best of both the [Provider](https://pub.dev/packages/provider) Pattern and BLoC Pattern without using code generation
* 
* Reduce Boiler Plate while still keeping the benefits of abstraction
